# Moroccan Journey - Modern UI/UX Redesign Prompt

## Project Overview
Redesign "The Journey Association" website as a premium Moroccan cultural tourism platform called **"Moroccan Journey"** with modern, immersive design that authentically represents Morocco's rich heritage while providing exceptional user experience for travelers seeking cultural adventures.

## Design Philosophy
Create a digital experience that feels like stepping into a Moroccan palace - luxurious, warm, inviting, and deeply rooted in authentic cultural elements. The design should evoke the sensory richness of Morocco: the golden light filtering through intricate mashrabiya screens, the warmth of desert sands, the coolness of tiled courtyards, and the vibrant energy of souks.
